# Hi, I'm Negin Amirsoleimani 👋
**Machine Learning Engineer — Toronto, ON**

I build end-to-end ML systems—from data pipelines and model training to deployment and monitoring. Comfortable across Python, cloud ML infra (AWS/GCP), and MLOps (Docker/Kubernetes/CI/CD). Interested in cloud-native databases, vector search/similarity, and publishable research.
